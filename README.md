# Appointment Scheduling Application

Purpose: This application aims to manage a group of customers, users, and contacts and the appointments they are associated with. Due to removal of access from the 
MySQL workbench, images of each screen and descriptions of functionality will be provided.

The login screen provides the function for users to log in using their credentials. Only users with matching credentials will be allowed to proceed. Otherwise, they will
receive an alert to try again.

The options screen offers the user three options: customers form, appointments form, and reports form. Users will be forwarded to the appropriate screen once an option
is selected.

the table.
